# Passman
This is a password manager for your personal use.

## Description

This application is built using Scene Builder,
Java, and Intellij. It was built as a part of my own interests in having a safe program
where I was the author.  I don't really trust large companies to store my personal
information.  Thus, I made a solution for myself.  Using this app in combination with my password 
generator app will keep your online profile secure.  The application uses AES encryption to 
secure your information.  I left the choice up to the user when to encrypt/decrypt info and 
where to load and save the information on your computer.
